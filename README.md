# STAT 547M

## Assignment 9

This repository contains all files for this assignment. 

My addition to the pipeline is an analysis that counts the number of times each letter occurs as a first character in the words listed in the words.txt file. I had to update the makefile, and add in a new R script and a new R markdown file. I also deleted the old R script and old R markdown file that are not relevant to my analysis.
